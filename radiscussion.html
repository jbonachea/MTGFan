	      <td colspan="2">This card is great for any solid Red / Green aggro decks that need to compete against control decks which is a meta that is dominant in Magic.  The riot ability also gives you some flexibility for your creatures</td>

	      <td colspan="2">Verity Circle is another good card for control.  A solid card advantage enchantment that allows you to draw a card when the opponent taps his card to activate a creature ability.  Additionally this plays well with spells that allow you to tap your opponent's creatures, including it's own tap ability</td>
	      <th>Summary</th>
	      <td colspan="2">This guy will easily fit into most decks that can cast it.  This guy not only is a solid cost value card, being a 3 drop 3/3 with Trample, that can come in as a 4/4 if you need.  Additionally being able to give you the player hexproof is a nice addition that allows you to avoid direct damage spells and removal spells like Settle the Wreckage</td>

	      <td colspan="2">Another solid creature that can come our as a 3 drop if you damage the opponent.  On top of the Flying and Trample, it also pings the opponent for a damage a turn (which would enable any Spectacle ability), and when your life goes low the creature grows in power as well.</td>
	      <th>Summary</th>
	      <td colspan="2">This card will be fun and kind of flexible on where it can go.  I see if being a good choice for control, as it can pump out cheap blockers and it's -7 ability really helps in digging for the right card.  I can also see this fitting into any deck that benefits from flying creatures.</td>

	      <th>Summary</th>
	      <td colspan="2">This is a very solid 2 drop mana dork that can grow later in the game to give you a nice 3/5 blocker that also gives you more mana to tap.  Also if you can find a way to get a counter on it ( like Rythm of the Wild), it taps for 3 mana instead of one.</td>
