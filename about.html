      <h2>Magic: The Gathering</h2>  
      <p>In 1991, Dr. Richard Garfield, a doctoral candidate in combinatorial mathematics approached an early Wizards Of the Coast to produce a board game.  The CEO at the time, Peter Adkison determined they didn't have the resources to produce a board game so asked Garfield to instead produce a card game.  So, Garfield went back to the drawing board and in 1993 Magic: The Gathering debuted. It was an instant success!</p>
      <p>In 1996, the game was popular enough that the Magic Pro Tour came about.  This was an invite-only tournament structure that offered over $1 million in prizes a year.  To qualify for an invite, players competed in a worldwide system of qualifier tournaments and large events that to earn a spot.</p>
      <p>In 2002, the game officially hit the mainstream digital market with Magic Online (there were a few prior video games that popped up prior to this that weren't as popular).</p>
      <p>MTG Arena is the next current digital title they are working on that is currently in Open Beta. This digital release is designed to be more streamlined and easier to use for everyone, yet still is very playable to more advanced players. This year (2019) they plan to start holding official tournaments through Arena with official prize pools.</p>
      <p>Today an estimation of over 12 million people worldwide play the game in person and online.

      <h2>My MTG Career</h2>
      <p>I started playing magic back in Junior High when the game was still relatively new.  They just recently release Fallen Empires (1994) and packs were made up of 8 cards (now they are 15).  I started out very casually, playing with just a small group of friends for fun.  Local game store tournaments weren't very well supported and were few and far between. After I graduated from high school in 2002, I stopped playing and focused on other areas of my life and different hobbies.</p>
      <p>Luckily later on in life I was able to come back to playing the game.  I got back into the game with my son as a father / son bonding deal back when Return to Ravnica (2012) was released. Luckily the magic community and Friday Night Magic were a lot more established and so a good portion of my Friday Evening have been spent with my son playing competitively at the local game stores.</p>
